# Uber-Ride-Analysis-Power-BI-Dashboard
Built interactive Power Bl dashboards analyzing ride demand, customer patterns, and peak hours. Delivered insights to optimize resource allocation and improve decision-making.

 This dashboard includes:
 ✅ Vehicle type analysis (e.g., Uber Comfort, Uber Green)
 ✅ Location insights (popular pickup & drop-off points)
 ✅ KPI cards for total bookings, trip distance, booking value & average trip time
 ✅ Dynamic pie and area charts driven by selected metrics
 ✅ Heatmap visualizing demand trends by day & hour
 ✅ Slicers for filtering by date and city
 ✅ Drill-through feature for detailed trip-level exploration
 
This project helped me dive deeper into user behavior, service performance, and peak demand trends — all crucial for data-driven decision-making in mobility and transportation.
